# String_Matching_Project
In this Project, I am reading data from 2 excel files. Both have some similarity but I would like to find the exact match. 

So, I used SequenceMatcher - It is a class available in python module named “difflib”. It can be used for comparing pairs of input sequences. 
It helps me in comparing the 2 strings and then I found the ratio for the same. 

I displayed the maximum score of that ratio as my output for comparing strings.
